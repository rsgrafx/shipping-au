# Vamp Sendle Integration

**TODO: Complete this Documentation **

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `sendle` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:sendle, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## WIP

This this library will either be integrated as a standalone lib in a (umbrella application) or may be run as a service.  TBD.
